###### Question 1
###### Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
The goal of this app was to proof of concept an inventory management system. Developing a login screen and a way for a user to view and manage items. 

###### Question 2
###### What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
The screens necessary for the user were a login screen as well as a grid edit view that the user could interact with. In addition I created a manage items screen. I wouldnt call my designs successful. 

###### Question 3
###### How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
For this assignment I attempted to go feature by feature. Starting with navigation then screen interaction. then functions. This really failed me I think developing screen by screen would be a better approach. 

###### Question 4
###### How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
Mostly I ran and checked and ran and checked. I failed to use the debugger to its fullest potential for this assignment. Also there could probably be some set of actual design tests built for this assignment. 

###### Question 5
###### Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
I had to overcome a lot of challenges in this assignment. The ones that I found I had to rise from were first on interpretting the requirements and again on interpretting the assignments. 

###### Question 6
###### In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
I do believe my navigation was very well done. I managed both flow between frames and between activities.
